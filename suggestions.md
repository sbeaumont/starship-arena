<@226060189374218240> I'm loving the look of the game from the look of the guide. I have two suggestions for improvement
1. Laser range isn't clearly explained - and I assume rockets continue to fly until they are triggered?
2. The ship models could probably do with a better naming system. I keep finding ships I like then losing them because the serial numbers are hard to remember lol

Lasers can't target names with a non-alfanum character.
