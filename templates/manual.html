<h1>Welcome to Space Arena</h1>
<p><i>Generated on {{ date }}</i></p>

<p>This game is a recreation of an old Play-By-Mail game from 1991. In this game teams of space ships battle
each other in a 2D arena. The game is a simulation where players all send in their orders before a round is
processed. A round consists of 10 clock <i>ticks</i> and the results of the players' commands gets processed
into a result output (HTML & PDF). Each ship receives their own result based on what they observed. This
information is used to plan the next round and send in new orders, and the cycle continues until there is a
winner.</p>

<h2>Game rounds</h2>

<p>The game is played in rounds of 10 ticks. Each round you send in a set of commands for that round. When the round
is processed, all ships move and act according to their commands. The results of the round are then sent back to each
ship's player and the cycle continues until the end conditions are reached.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>You send commands in a .txt file. Enter one command per line, with the format <span class="code-style">(tick number): (command)</span>.
<b>You can write multiple commands per tick</b>, but they each should be on their own line. Whitespace in the commands does not matter: you can write R 90 or R90,
whatever is your preference.</p>

<p>The following commands let the ship accelerate by 25 and turn 90 degrees left on tick 1,
and fire a rocket from the launcher called 'L1' 90 degrees from its current heading on tick 2. Note that the A25 line
is after the L90 line: the acceleration will always be processed before the turn in that tick.</p>

<pre class="code-style">
    1: L90
    1: A25
    2: Fire L1 90
</pre>

<p>Commands are for changes: you do not have to enter a command for every tick. If given no commands, your ship will
    fly straight at its current speed.</p>

<p>It does not matter in which order you put these lines, and it also does not matter if the tick numbers of
    the lines are out of order. All orders get processed in tick number order, and within a tick orders get processed
    in a specific order. Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored. You can use this for instance to group your
    movement and weapon commands together.</p>

<p> You can fire each weapon once per tick, and they might have
    temperature or ammo to take into account.
If you multiple commands to fire a specific weapon in the same tick, only the first command is executed. In this case line order does matter.</p>

<h2>Tick Processing</h2>

<p>Each tick is processed in a specific order, it is useful to know in what order everything is processed. For instance,
acceleration is done before turning, so you can do a fast turn within one tick by slowing down to 0 and then turning as
much as you want.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Start of tick. Some components do upkeep (Laser cools down).</li>
    <li>Generators generate energy, 1 energy per generator.</li>
    <li>Components that use energy per tick use their energy, draining the battery. Also the energy drain for the
    upcoming movement is deducted.</li>
    <li>Pre-move commands are executed.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Acceleration</li>
        <li>Turning</li>
        <li>Other pre-move commands (Activation)</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Movement</li>
    <li>Post-move commands are executed.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Fire weapons. This is when new missiles appear. Damage is done.</li>
        <li>Boost</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Ships, guided missiles etc. scan their environment.</li>
    <li>Guided missiles choose and intercept their target. Missiles in range of target explode and do damage.</li>
    <li>Destroyed objects are removed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Energy</h2>

<p>All the ships energy is stored on its central battery, and it can power several things, like lasers, shields and
ship's movement. Every generator on a ship produces 1 energy per tick and stores it in the battery.</p>

<p>Energy is used to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Boost shields with the Boost command at 1 point of shield per point of energy.</li>
    <li>Power movement at Speed / 10 energy per tick.</li>
    <li>Power lasers at 5 energy per shot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't forget: a Replenish <b>completely</b> fills the battery!</p>

<h2>Movement</h2>

<p><b>In movement everything is per tick.</b></p>

<p>Any object moves its speed every tick. So a ship with a speed of 30 moves 10 * 30 = 300 units in a full round of
10 ticks. A ship has a maximum speed, and can fly backwards with the same (negative) speed.</p>

<p>An object has a maximum turn rate in degrees per tick. An object with a maximum turn rate of 30 can make a full
circle in 360 / 30 = 12 ticks.</p>

<p>An object has a maximum acceleration in speed units per tick. So an object with a maximum acceleration of 20 and
a maximum speed of 40 can reach maximum velocity in 2 ticks.</p>

<p>Movement costs energy, at speed / 10 points energy per tick, rounded down. For instance, a ship with a speed
of 46 will spend 46 / 10 rounded down = 4 energy per tick on movement.</p>

<h3>Movement commands</h3>

<p>The movement commands are all <em>per tick</em>. They are:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><span class="code-style">A[number]</span></dt>
    <dd>Accelerate or decelerate by x units that tick. You can fly backwards (negative speed)</dd>
    <dt><span class="code-style">L[degrees]</span></dt>
    <dd>Turn x degrees to the left that tick.</dd>
    <dt><span class="code-style">R[degrees]</span></dt>
    <dd>Turn x degrees to the right that tick.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All movement-related commands are <b>relative</b> commands. Turning x degrees with respect to current heading,
    acceleration changes current speed by x amount, etc.</p>

<p><b>At speed 0 there is no limit to the turn rate.</b></p>

<p>If you give multiple turn or accelerate commands <em>in a single tick</em>, they get combined (added)
    into one command for that tick. If you turn beyond the maximum turn rate of the ship, the command gets constrained
    to the maximum. The same goes for maximum acceleration and speed.</p>

<h2>Weapons</h2>

<h3>Lasers</h3>

<p>Lasers are fired at a specific ship and always hit if they are in range. Lasers heat up per shot and can't fire
    when they are at or over their maximum temperature.Lasers always heat and use energy when fired, even when
    there's no target, so don't just spam fire commands!</p>

    <tr>
        <th>Energy per shot</th>
        <th>Damage per shot</th>
        <th>Heat per shot</th>
        <th>Max Temperature</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>Strength - Distance</td>
        <td>20</td>

    </tr>
</table>
</p>

<h3>Missiles</h3>

<p>Missiles are fired in a direction from a missile launcher. Guided missiles (Splinter) will target the
nearest object they see, but not the firing ship or its missiles. Regular Rockets fly in a straight line.
A missile has a triggering range. Once a target moves within this range, the missile will explode. When a 
missile explodes, it damages *everything* in range, including its origin ship and rockets. Guided missiles 
will scan for near targets in a 45 degree cone in front of them and adapt their trajectory to intercept. 
These missiles do not target their origin ship and its missiles. </p>

<p>Missile launchers have limited ammo, but can be restocked by replenishing at a star base. Currently all 
    missiles have speed 60 and fizzle out after 15 ticks. This means they have a range of 60 * 15 = 750.</p>

<p><b>Rockets</b> are unguided missiles with a trigger- and blast radius of 20 and 50 damage. They fly at a speed of
60 units per tick.</p>

<p><b>Splinter</b> missiles are guided missile that chase the closest target that is not its originator or its
missiles. They fly at a speed of 60 units per tick. The missile will scan for targets in cone shaped 45 degrees and 150
distance units in front. It has a trigger- and blast radius of 6, and their damage linearly scales down from 75 at 0 distance 
to 0 damage at 6 distance. They are quite smart in that they predict a target's movement and will on approach will slow
down to exactly close the distance to their target. Guided missiles will target other missiles, so shooting a missile
    back at them is a good way to defend against them.</p>

<p><b>Power Splinter</b> missiles are more powerful versions of the Splinter missile. They have a base damage of
100 vs. the regular Splinter's 75.</p>

<p><b>Nano</b> missiles release a cloud of nanites that are specialized in eating through matter, and are therefore
dangerous to a ship's hull: they do double damage to it. However, they completely burn up against a shield and do
not damage it, so this weapon will <b>only</b> work if it hits a ship through a broken shield!</p>

<p><b>EMP</b> missiles drain energy from shields and batteries. When they hit shields they do double damage, and
any remaining strength when it hits the hull does not damage it, but drains the battery. EMP missiles score 1
point for every two units of energy they drain, whether from shields or battery.</p>

<h2>Scanners</h2>

<h3>Gravscan</h3>

<p>The Grav scanner is a component that you can use to find opponents at long range. Each ping costs 10 energy, but
it allows you to scan at long distances, up to 6000 units at the smallest scan cone (30 degrees).</p>

<h2>Defense</h2>

<h3>Shields</h3>

<p>Shields are the outer defense of a ship: a shield has to be broken before the hull is damaged. A ship's shield
is divided in quadrants that each cover an arc of 90 degrees (North, East, South, West). Each quadrant has its own
    strength and needs to be boosted separately. Each point of shield prevents one point of damage.</p>

<p>Shields can be <span class="code-style">Boost</span>ed to recover them. This uses energy from the battery: 1 point
of energy for 1 point of shield. Shields can be boosted to twice their normal maximum, but any excess strength is lost
at the end of the round. However, well timed boosts allow you to tank quite some damage!</p>

<h3>Cloak</h3>

<p>Ships and guided missiles have a scan range within which they can scan objects around them.
    Some ships have a cloaking device. It shortens the range at which the cloaked ship can be detected. The strength of
the cloak determines how much the others' scan range is shortened when detecting the cloaked ship.</p>

<p>If the strength of a cloak is 0.2, it makes the others' scan range a factor 0.2 (20%) shorter, e.g.
    <span class="code-style">100 - 20% = 80</span>. A ship with a scan range of 100 will not detect a
    strength-0.2-cloaked ship if it is beyond a range of 80.</p>

<p>Cloaks use 10 energy per tick, and can be turned on and off with the <span class="code-style">Activate</span>
command.</p>

<h2>Ships</h2>

<p>Ships are player-controlled war machines. They come in different configurations.</p>
